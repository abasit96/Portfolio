        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, great to have you on my page! I have been enrolled in Arizona University's Fullstack Bootcamp since December 2022. My goal is to get a career in the IT field.
            <br>

            I’ll share a little bit of my past first. I graduated from Rutgers University with a BA in English and a minor in Business and Technical Writing. During Covid and after, I applied routinely to various jobs, attended numerous job fairs, and tried to find new pathways for income. I don’t consider my degree to be worthless because it has benefited me in other aspects of life. But, monetarily it hasn’t been the most lucrative choice. 
            <br>

            That brings us to now. The choice to enroll in an IT Bootcamp has not been ex nihilo. In fact, many of my close relatives work or have worked in the IT field. And many of those relatives have time and again tried to convince me to try it out. Considering their recommendation, I have decided to take a journey into this world.
